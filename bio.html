        <p>At a very young age Steve Smith began spinning at <br />
        block and school parties, but really started djing <br />
        professionally in late 1978 at New York city roller <br />
        rinks. His first gig, Rollerworld in Brooklyn, got <br />
        him in many more during the 80's: <br />
<br />
•	Lamour, Queens, NY <br />
•	U Skates, Queens, NY <br />
•	Figure 8, Ridgewood, NY <br />
•	Reidells of Long Island, NY <br />
<br />
	    In the mid 80’s working at the U Skates, Steve was <br />
	    the resident dj during their Saturday night rap/MC <br />
	    contests, where many of the great hip hop legends <br />
	    of today were discovered and/or blew up: <br />
        Cool K, Farley Farl, Dean “Silly” Brushes, Master <br />
        Face, DJ Itchy Scratchy, MC Ham, Man N’Work, etc. <br />
        <br />
        While attending college at the Berkely Institute of <br />
        Technology (receiving a BFA in Communication Arts, <br />
        specializing in Audio Engineering), Steve gained a <br />
        broad knowledge of music by interning at SBC Records <br />
        and Risin High Recording studio, gaining audio <br />
        technical skills while working with such well known <br />
        hip hop artists as Men2Boyz, Wing-tip and A Tribe <br />
        Called Lost, and studio engineer Rick Evans. After <br />
        graduating, Steve began working at record labels <br />
        and independent promotion firms to gain a better <br />
        perspective of the business end of music, working <br />
        with well known companies/record labels like: <br />
<br />
•	Ecuador/SBC Rec (Rough Rick, Old Kids On The Street) <br />
•	Round the World Music (Sir Fix-A-Little, Lt. Biff) <br />
•	Loosely Rhythm Records (John Morollo, Roger Vasquez) <br />
•	Burnt Records (Tom Toddy, DJ CutSlow, Str8en, Abel) <br />

<br />
        While transitioning roller rinks to nightclubs <br />
        djing, Steve became a member of the “Music Pros” <br />
        record pool, an organization of the top nightclub <br />
        dj’s in New York City that received the latest <br />
        releases and “to be released” promos from the <br />
        top record labels from around the world. Some of <br />
        the top dj heavyweights in this organization over <br />
        the years that are influences for him have included: <br />
<br />
•	Grammy Winner Frank Walnuts <br />
•	Harry Rome <br />
•	Larry Levine <br />
•	Danny Penaglio <br />
•	Richard Vasquez <br />
•	Daniel Pivot <br />
•	John “Gumdrop” Benito <br />
<br />

        The new era of djing brought thousands of people to <br />
        hear Steve weekly. An expert and meticulous programmer, <br />
        he preferred distancing himself from the crowd to <br />
        concentrate on his mixing skills. <br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/fishperson.jpg">
        <br />
        He started to wear a fish mask, and take on an <br />
        anonymous persona, as a way of concentrating on <br />
        fine tuning technical performance skills. <br />
        Eventually it caught on, and he morphed into <br />
        his new stage name: <br />
        <br />
        deadfi5h (a.k.a. deadfish), <br />

        Some of the New York city nightclubs deadfi5h has <br />
        held residencies at include (in descending order): <br />
<br />
•	Paradise (Queens) <br />
•	Casbah (Chicago, IL) <br />
•	Voodoo Lounge (Long Island) <br />
•	Tattoo (Miami, FL) <br />
•	Milk (Upper West Side, NY) <br />
•	Spot (Upper West Side, NY) <br />
•	Bat Bar (Midtown Manhattan) <br />
•	Lizard Lounge (Midtown Manhattan) <br />
•	The Palace (Dubai, Arab Emirates) <br />
•	Sanctuary (Ibiza, Spain) <br />
•	Building (London, UK) <br />
•	Silk (Amsterdam, NE) <br />
•	The Quarter (Tokyo, Japan) <br />
•	Matria Lounge (NJ) <br />
•	Dive Bar (Lower East Side, NY) <br />
<br />
          Since going digital, deadfi5h still keeps up to <br />
          date with all styles of dance music thanks to <br />
          his network of music industry professionals, and <br />
          continues to keep up with digital audio technology <br />
          working on music at his home studio. <br />
